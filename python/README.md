hello :D
this is a compilation of original python scripts used by myself;

hpc-scripts.py and calc-scripts.py are for school, and other students may find it as an accelerator of their homework completion as well >:)

nt-scripts.py is for number-theoretic procedures, and developed and used for purposes outside of school.

anyone is free to use them, you don't even have to give me credit, these scripts only exist because they saved me time :D

\[no snitch thank :)\]

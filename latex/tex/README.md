OK, this folder's a complete mess, not to mind the chaotic naming of dirs.
...
Universal.sty is a simple package with some added macros & etc by myself. Serves as backend to the other LaTeX classes I've written: `nyan`, `seto`, `amts`, `tropical`, etc. May see some instances of its macros in the demo files for `seto.cls`.

Tropical.cls is a document class for LaTeX presentations, with additions made to Warsaw Beamer, including recoloring and a few other features... intentionally deviates from `seto` color theme.

OK, enough said, just try to use it?

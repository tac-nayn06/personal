nyanya.sty is an original open-source LaTeX package written by GitHub user tac-nayn06 in April 2021, intended mainly for use in writing math papers. Stuff here is more default than seto.sty.

To figure out how to use it, one may see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFS__bdUUtTLLxgAzGJT1vfae9jQwDeZ/view?usp=sharing, a sample file containing documentation.

(_Remark._ Garish color theme from Nyan Cat, as its name suggests. Just use seto.cls already...)

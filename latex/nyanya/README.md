nyanya.sty is an original open-source LaTeX package written by GitHub user tac-nayn06 in April 2021, intended mainly for use in writing math papers.

Currently the package pretty simple, but to figure out how to use it, one may see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFS__bdUUtTLLxgAzGJT1vfae9jQwDeZ/view?usp=sharing .

Questions and commments should be directed via Discord DM to epsilon#8682, or via email to nyyanyn@gmail.com.

(_Remark._ Garish color theme from Nyan Cat, as its name suggests. Just use seto.sty already(if possible)...)

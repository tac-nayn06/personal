Seto.sty is a variant LaTeX package of nyanya.sty(also open-source), with changed fonts and colors. Functionally the two are pretty similar(although seto.sty has slightly more features).

Sample file with documentation can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HcT4R7FCLX93fEinpw8kT973BqPJD9Wt/view?usp=sharing.

Also I want to see someone's reaction when I name a package after them lululul

Edit: I'm proud to have my novel idea of a dark green sty appear in another package: https://github.com/chennisden/texmf/blob/d7b820adc09bde215370b40002bb1472a92fc3d6/tex/latex/forest.sty

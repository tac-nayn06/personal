Seto.sty is a variant LaTeX package of nyanya.sty, with changed fonts and colors. Functionally the two are pretty similar. It is also open-source.

Also I want to see someone's reaction when I name a package after them lululul

Edit: I'm proud to have my idea of a dark green sty appear in another package: https://github.com/chennisden/geometryexplorer/blob/gh-pages/texmf/tex/latex/forest.sty

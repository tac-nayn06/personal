Seto.sty is a variant LaTeX package of nyanya.sty(also open-source), with changed fonts and colors. Functionally the two are pretty similar(although seto.sty has slightly more features).

Also I want to see someone's reaction when I name a package after them lululul

Edit: I'm proud to have my novel idea of a dark green sty appear in another package: https://github.com/chennisden/geometryexplorer/blob/gh-pages/texmf/tex/latex/forest.sty

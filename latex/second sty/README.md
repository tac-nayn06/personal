Seto.cls is a style file created by tac-nayn06, with more features and refinement in general. By now it has a lot more than nyan.cls, so you should probably stick to this one if you come across my GH.

ok just see https://unity858.github.io/latex/geo-favs.pdf for a demo of what it does bc im too lazy to list all my own macros, screw it

\maketitle
Wow, an integration of a tweaked version of \texttt{usamts} ``official" file and my personal style, \texttt{seto.cls}.
\toc
\begin{amtssol}
\subsection{Loading}
This style is def'd as a class, hence it is used by prepending \fakecmd{documentclass\{amts\}}.
\subsection{More ``seto'' things}
Boxes, commands, etc from \texttt{seto} work here.
\remark{Who is \rname? I'll keep quiet... we don't talk about that heh {\lato <//3}}
\subsection{Sol environment}
Although \texttt{seto} has a sol env, one should use the env \texttt{amtssol} for USAMTS; well, why else would  somebody use this file instead of \texttt{seto.cls}?
\claim{See, claims look about the same here\dots}
OK, I don't even know what the hell this is.
\end{amtssol}
